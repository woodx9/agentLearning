# QuickStar - Smart Context Agent

[中文版本](./README_zh.md)

A ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) based AI agent system supporting **real-time streaming output**, **intelligent history management**, **cost tracking**, **smart context cropping**, tool calling, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Chapter6 Major Updates

### 1. TodoWrite Tool - Structured Task Management **[NEW]**

Chapter6's flagship feature is the **TodoWrite Tool**, providing intelligent task management and progress tracking:
- 🎯 **Smart Task Organization**: Automatically creates structured todo lists for multi-step tasks
- 📋 **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Updates task status in real-time as work progresses
- 🔄 **Intelligent State Management**: Manages pending, in_progress, and completed task states
- 🧠 **Context-Aware Creation**: Proactively identifies when todo lists would be beneficial
- ⚡ **Seamless Integration**: Integrates naturally with existing tool chain and workflow
- 📊 **Visual Progress Display**: Shows comprehensive task status with progress indicators

#### 🎯 When TodoWrite is Used
```python
# Complex multi-step tasks - 3+ distinct operations
User: "Add dark mode toggle, run tests, and build the app"
→ Creates structured todo list automatically

# Multiple tasks from user - comma-separated or numbered lists
User: "Implement user registration, product catalog, shopping cart"
### 2. Enhanced Productivity & Organization **[NEW]**

#### 📝 Proactive Task Management
- **Automatic Detection**: Recognizes when tasks require systematic tracking
- **Progress Transparency**: Users always know current task status and next steps
- **Completion Validation**: Ensures tasks are fully completed before marking as done
- **Error Prevention**: Prevents marking tasks complete when tests fail or errors occur

#### 🔄 Intelligent Task Flow

**Chapter5 (Manual Planning):**
```
🤖 I'll help you implement these features
*Proceeds without clear tracking*
```

**Chapter6 (Structured Management):**
```
🤖 Let me create a todo list to track this implementation
✅ Created 4 tasks: user auth, product catalog, cart, checkout
🔄 Starting with user authentication...
✅ Completed: user authentication setup
### 3. Smart Decision Engine for Task Management

#### 🧠 Intelligent Usage Detection
- **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates if tasks require systematic tracking (3+ steps)
- **User Intent Recognition**: Identifies explicit or implicit requests for organization
- **Scope Assessment**: Determines when todo lists provide organizational benefit
- **Context Awareness**: Understands when NOT to use todos for simple tasks

#### ⚡ Performance & Efficiency
- **Single Task Optimization**: Skips todo creation for trivial, single-step tasks
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates task status immediately as work progresses
- **Memory Efficiency**: Maintains task state across conversation context
- **Progress Persistence**: Tracks completion status throughout session

#### 🛡️ Quality Assurance Integration
- **Test Validation**: Only marks tasks complete when tests pass
- **Error Handling**: Keeps tasks in-progress when encountering failures
- **Completion Criteria**: Ensures all requirements met before marking done
- **Dependency Tracking**: Manages task dependencies and prerequisites

### 4. Developer Experience Improvements

#### 🐛 Enhanced Debug Support
- **VSCode Configuration**: New chapter5-specific debug launch configuration
### 4. New Core Tool: TodoWrite

#### 🛠️ TodoWrite - Structured Task Management Tool

[`TodoWrite`](src/tools/todo_write.py) is Chapter6's flagship productivity enhancement:

**🎯 Core Functions**:
```python
def act(self, todos: List[Todo]) -> str:
    # Creates, updates, and manages structured task lists
    # Provides real-time progress tracking and status updates
```

**📋 Task States**:
- `pending`: Task not yet started
- `in_progress`: Currently working on (limit to ONE at a time)
- `completed`: Task finished successfully

**🔧 Tool Parameters**:
- `todos`: List of task objects with id, content, and status
- Automatic reminder system for task management
- Real-time status updates and progress tracking

#### ⚡ Usage Scenarios

**1. Feature Development**:
```bash
# Multi-component feature requiring systematic approach
todo_write([
    {"id": "1", "content": "Create user authentication API", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "2", "content": "Build frontend login component", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "3", "content": "Implement session management", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "4", "content": "Add security middleware", "status": "pending"}
])
```

**2. Bug Fix Workflow**:
```bash
# Systematic debugging approach
todo_write([
    {"id": "1", "content": "Reproduce error in development", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"id": "2", "content": "Identify root cause in codebase", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "3", "content": "Implement fix and write tests", "status": "pending"},
    {"id": "4", "content": "Validate fix in staging environment", "status": "pending"}
])
#### 🔍 Smart Management Logic

Tool features intelligent decision-making:
- **Task Assessment**: Automatically evaluates if todo lists add value
- **Scope Recognition**: Identifies complex vs simple task requirements  
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks completion status and prevents premature marking
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains task state throughout conversation
- **Reminder System**: Automatically reminds about pending task management

## Summary

The core idea of this framework is to let AI "think" (through conversation) and "act" (through tool calls), requiring user confirmation for potentially risky operations. Chapter6's TodoWrite tool introduces systematic task management, providing users with structured workflow organization and automated progress tracking. Combined with Chapter5's smart cropping and enhanced user interaction capabilities, the system now offers a comprehensive productivity platform that helps users manage complex projects with confidence and clarity, building towards truly practical AI assistants.
